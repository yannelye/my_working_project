# Recipe for Creating a New Working Project Environment

This README outlines the steps used to set up a clean and functional Python project environment using GitHub and VS Code.

## Steps

1. Create a new project repository or clone an existing one and open it in VS Code or a GitHub Codespace.

2. Open the terminal and confirm that you are working in the root directory of the project.

3. Create a Python virtual environment to isolate project dependencies and activate it.

4. Update pip if necessary to ensure package installations run correctly.

5. Install any Python packages required for the project using pip.

6. Save all installed packages and their versions into a requirements.txt file to support reproducibility.

7. Add the virtual environment folder to the .gitignore file

8. In VS Code, select the Python interpreter associated with the virtual environment.

9. Run a simple test or script to verify that the environment is working properly.

10. Save all project files, commit the changes, and push them to GitHub.
